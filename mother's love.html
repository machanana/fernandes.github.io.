	<p>When we realized that there is nothing in the world like a mother's love, so we begin<br> to understand how our own mothers lived all this time  
	<p>As we grow older, we realize that a mother's love is unique. For it is capable of, overcoming any other feeling in the world..</p>
	<p>I bring you today this tale that relates the strength of a mother's love .</p>
	<p>Much is said about mothers and the power of their love.</p>
	<p>One of the most significant cases, of course, was what Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ros<br> reported	.</p> 
	<p>At the hospital where he worked, he met a lady with a terrible illness who had been<br> hospitalized ten times..</p>
	<p>However, after the seizures, he improved and returned home. </p>				
   <p>The hospital staff did not understand how this woman continued to resist and did not <br>die.
   then one day Mrs. Schwartz explained that her husband was a schizophrenic and assaulted his younger son, then seventeen, each time he had one of his attacks..</p>
   <P>She feared for her son's life if she died before the boy came of age. 
   <p>If she died, her husband would be her son's only legal guardian.</p>
   <p>She wondered what would happen to the boy at the hands of a parent with such a problem.</P>
   <p>Is that why I can't die yet?</p>						 
   <P>what kept this woman alive, what gave her the strength to fight death every time she <br>presented herself, was exactly the love of her child.</P>					      
   <P>How to leave it under these circumstances?.</P>
   <P>Therefore, she fought and fought always.</P>
     <p>The doctor, observing with emotion the physical and moral suffering of this woman, decided to help her, providing a lawyer so that this mother, so worried, transfer the <br>custody of the boy to a more reliable relative.. </p>	
	<p>Relieved, the patient left the hospital infinitely grateful to be able to live in peace for the <br>remaining time. Now, he said, when death comes, I will be calm and be able to leave.<br>She still lived just over a year, then left her physical body in peace when the time came..</p>
   <p>Story reminds us of all the anonymous heroines who become mothers in the name of<br> love. </p>	
	<p>History reminds us of all the anonymous heroines who become mothers in the name of love.</p>		
	<p>From those who work from sun to sun, picking paper from the streets, working in<br> industries or factories, and returning home early in the evening to serve dinner to their young children.<br>
	<p>Oversee the school lessons, sing a song while they fall asleep in your arms..</p>	
    <p>And the mothers of physically and mentally handicapped people who spend hours<br> and hours every day exercising their children as directed by the professionals, just so<br> that they can walk, move a little, express themselves..</p>
	<p>Anonymous mothers, heroines of love, all of us on earth owe our existence to such a creature. And how many of us have yet to thank the intellectual development achieved, <br>the diploma, the successful career, the emotional maturity, the result of years of unparalleled dedication..</p>
    <p>If you enjoy the joy of having your mother by your side on earth, be sure to honor your days with the flowers of gratitude.
	<p>If the days of old age have reached her, fill her days with joy. Caress your snowy hair<br> with the tenderness of your hands.</p>
	<p>Remind her that her life is ennobled by her example signs, the endless sacrifices, the <br>tears shed from her eyes.
   and, picking up the light perfume of the morning, surprise her<br> by saying: Blessed be thou always, my Mother..</p>
